I am a final year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science at the [University of Illinois at Chicago](https://cs.uic.edu/), under the supervision of [Jason Polakis](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~polakis/aboutme/). 
My research focuses on Web Security and Privacy, with a particular emphasis on privacy-invasive attacks and  browser-based user tracking and fingerprinting.
My research interests include web security and privacy attacks and mitigations, large-scale internet measurements, and cybercrime.

Prior to my Ph.D., I earned my undergraduate and graduate degrees from the [University of Crete](https://csd.uoc.gr), where I also worked as a graduate research assistant at [FORTH](https://ics.forth.gr).

<span style="color:red">I am on the academic job market. Please feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss my research, potential collaborations, or academic opportunities!</span>
